# forkify

This is project is from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!".
This project is about searching for recepies using vanilla JS and making api calls using async await.
The MVC pattern is being implemented
The html and css have been provided.

However, since the https://www.food2fork.com/ api is down and I don't like the recomended http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/ api, I am using http://www.edaman.com api.

I have decided to use the edaman api because it seems to have a wider database.
For example, "tomato pasta" search with edaman returns results but with forkify api there are no results.
