# forkify

## This is project is from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!".

This project is about searching for recepies using vanilla JS.
The html and css have been provided by the owner of the course.

- implented api calls using async await.
- implemented MVC pattern in this project

## Note

However, since the https://www.food2fork.com/ api is down and I don't like the recomended http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/ api, I am using http://www.edaman.com api.

- I have decided to use the edaman api because it seems to have a wider database.
  For example, "tomato pasta" search with edaman returns results but with forkify api there are no results.
- Since it's a different api I implented this project differently but followed the same structure to use the UI provided.
