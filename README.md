# forkify

This is project is from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!".
This project is about searching for recepies using vanilla JS and making api calls using async await.
The html and css have been provided.

However, since the https://www.food2fork.com/ api is down and I don't like the recomended http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/ api, I am using http://www.recipepuppy.com api.
The recomended api usually gives more hits than the one I'm using.
I have decided to use the recipepuppy api because it seems to have a wider database. For example, "tomato pasta" search with recipepuppy I get results but with forkify api there are no results.
